        "# Error Handling\n",
        "\n",
        "Error handling in Python is a way to manage and respond to exceptions, which are errors that disrupt the normal flow of a program. Using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks, Python allows you to handle exceptions gracefully, letting your program continue running or respond appropriately to errors. Here's how each component works:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **`try` Block**\n",
        "The `try` block is where you write code that may raise an exception. Python will attempt to execute code in this block. If an exception occurs, Python will move to the `except` block (if one exists) instead of crashing the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **`except` Block**\n",
        "The `except` block catches and handles specific exceptions or a general exception if you don't specify a type. You can specify different `except` blocks for different types of exceptions if you need unique responses for each.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **`else` Block**\n",
        "The `else` block executes if no exception was raised in the `try` block. It is useful for code that should only run if everything in the `try` block succeeded.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **`finally` Block**\n",
        "The `finally` block will always run after the `try` and `except` blocks, regardless of whether an exception was raised. It’s often used for cleanup tasks, like closing a file or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Syntax:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    # Code that might raise an exception\n",
        "    pass\n",
        "except SomeException as e:\n",
        "    # Code that handles the specific exception\n",
        "    pass\n",
        "except AnotherException as e:\n",
        "    # Code that handles another exception\n",
        "    pass\n",
        "else:\n",

        "- **`finally`**: Runs after everything else, whether or not there was an exception. Here, it just prints a message.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output Scenarios\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Valid Input** (e.g., user enters `5`):\n",

        "   Enter a number: 5\n",

        "   End of try-except block.\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Use `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally`?\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Control and clarity**: Prevents your program from crashing by gracefully handling errors.\n",
        "- **Error-specific responses**: Allows different actions for different errors, making your code flexible.\n",
        "- **Clean-up**: The `finally` block ensures that certain code always runs, which is critical for tasks like closing files, network connections, or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Nested Try-Except and Exception Handling\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also nest `try-except` blocks to handle exceptions at different levels of your code:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    try:\n",
        "        f = open(\"test.txt\", \"r\")\n",
        "        contents = f.read()\n",
        "    except FileNotFoundError:\n",
        "        print(\"File not found.\")\n",
        "    else:\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points:\n",
        "- **Catching specific exceptions**: Handling known exceptions with specific `except` blocks allows targeted responses.\n",
        "- **Avoiding generic `except`**: While you can catch all exceptions with a plain `except`, it’s generally better to specify the exception type, so you don’t unintentionally catch and hide unexpected errors.\n",
        "- **Using `finally` for cleanup**: Essential for resource management to ensure resources like files or connections are properly closed.\n",

        "   - **Definition**: Unit testing involves testing the smallest parts of an application independently to make sure they work correctly.\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: By writing unit tests, you ensure each part of your code functions as expected, making it easier to spot bugs early.\n",
        "   - **Automation**: Once written, tests can be automatically run to check if changes or new code break existing functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **The `unittest` Module**\n",
        "   Python’s built-in `unittest` module, also known as **PyUnit**, follows the structure and conventions of xUnit, a standard framework for unit testing. It provides:\n",
        "   - Test case setup and teardown functions.\n",
        "   - Assertions to test expected outcomes.\n",
        "   - Test suite and test runner functionalities for grouping and executing tests.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Setting Up Your First Unit Test**\n",

        "    return x - y\n",
        "```\n",

        "To test these functions, create a separate file called `test_math_operations.py`, where you’ll write your unit tests.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Basic Structure of a Unit Test\n",
        "In `unittest`, a test case is created by subclassing `unittest.TestCase`. Each test method should start with the word `test` to indicate that it’s a test and should include assertions to validate the function's behavior.\n",

        "```python\n",

        "        self.assertEqual(add(-1, 1), 0)  # -1 + 1 should be 0\n",
        "        self.assertEqual(add(0, 0), 0)   # 0 + 0 should be 0\n",

        "\n",
        "### 5. **Assertions in `unittest`**\n",
        "\n",
        "Assertions are methods provided by `unittest.TestCase` to verify test outcomes. Here are some common ones:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`assertEqual(a, b)`**: Checks if `a == b`.\n",
        "- **`assertNotEqual(a, b)`**: Checks if `a != b`.\n",
        "- **`assertTrue(x)`**: Checks if `x` is `True`.\n",
        "- **`assertFalse(x)`**: Checks if `x` is `False`.\n",
        "- **`assertIn(a, b)`**: Checks if `a` is in `b`.\n",
        "- **`assertRaises(Exception, func, *args, **kwargs)`**: Checks if `func(*args, **kwargs)` raises the specified `Exception`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Running the Tests**\n",
        "\n",
        "To run the tests, navigate to your terminal, go to the directory containing `test_math_operations.py`, and run:\n",
        "\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "python -m unittest test_math_operations.py\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "If all tests pass, you’ll see an output like:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "..\n",
        "----------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "Ran 2 tests in 0.001s\n",
        "\n",
        "OK\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "If a test fails, you’ll see an error message indicating which test failed and why.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **Setup and Teardown**\n",
        "\n",
        "In some cases, you may need to perform setup and cleanup tasks for each test (e.g., initializing objects, setting up a database connection, or cleaning up files). You can do this with the `setUp` and `tearDown` methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import unittest\n",
        "\n",

        "### 8. **Organizing and Running Multiple Tests**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Grouping tests**: You can create multiple test case classes (e.g., `TestAddition`, `TestSubtraction`) in the same test file to organize your tests better.\n",
        "- **Test discovery**: Run all tests in a folder using `unittest`'s built-in discovery by navigating to the directory and running:\n",

        "### 9. **Mocking with `unittest.mock` (Advanced)**\n",
        "\n",
        "For more complex tests, especially those involving external resources (e.g., databases, APIs), `unittest` provides a `mock` module to simulate external dependencies. For example, if you’re testing a function that makes an HTTP request, you can \"mock\" the request to simulate different responses without actually making the network call.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from unittest.mock import patch\n",

        "def test_some_function(self, mock_external_function):\n",
        "    mock_external_function.return_value = \"mocked result\"\n",
        "    # Test code here\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Write tests** for each function or method using a separate test file.\n",
        "2. **Use assertions** like `assertEqual`, `assertTrue`, etc., to check for expected outcomes.\n",
        "3. **Run tests** using `unittest` from the terminal.\n",
        "4. Use **setup and teardown** methods if you need setup or cleanup tasks for each test.\n",
        "5. Optionally, **mock dependencies** to control your testing environment and test more complex interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unit testing is a foundational skill for reliable software development, and mastering `unittest` helps you build software that’s robust, maintainable, and easier to debug."
