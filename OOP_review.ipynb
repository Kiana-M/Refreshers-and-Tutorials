        "### Key OOP Concepts in the Project\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Abstraction**:\n",
        "   - The `BankAccount` class is abstract, meaning it defines a template for accounts without implementing specifics.\n",
        "   - `deposit` and `withdraw` are abstract methods, forcing subclasses to define them.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Encapsulation**:\n",
        "   - `_balance` is a protected attribute (denoted by the underscore) and accessed through methods, which is good practice for protecting data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inheritance**:\n",
        "   - `CheckingAccount` and `SavingsAccount` inherit from `BankAccount` and extend its functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism**:\n",
        "   - Both `CheckingAccount` and `SavingsAccount` implement the `deposit` and `withdraw` methods, but each behaves differently based on the account type.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Composition**:\n",
        "   - `Transaction` uses `BankAccount` objects to perform operations, demonstrating composition where `Transaction` is not an account but can interact with accounts.\n",
        "\n",

        "# More on Encapulation\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, the `@property` decorator allows you to define methods that act like attributes. With `@property`, you can control how an attribute’s value is accessed or modified without directly exposing it, enhancing **encapsulation**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How `@property` Works\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Getter**: When you use `@property` on a method, it allows you to access that method like an attribute.\n",
        "2. **Setter (Optional)**: You can define a `@property_name.setter` method to control how the attribute can be set.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Use `@property`?\n",
        "\n",
        "The main advantages are:\n",
        "- **Encapsulation**: You can expose an attribute but control its access.\n",
        "- **Readability**: `@property` lets you keep the attribute-like syntax even when there’s logic behind accessing the value.\n",
        "- **Data Validation**: You can add validation or transformation logic in the getter and setter.\n",
