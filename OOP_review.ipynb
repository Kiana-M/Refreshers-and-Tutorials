        "**Class**: A blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Object**: An instance of a class. When you create an object, you are making an instance of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Attributes and Methods:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Attributes**: Variables that belong to an object or class (also known as properties).\n",

        "**Methods**: Functions defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of an object.\n",
        "\n",

        "### **Encapsulation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The practice of keeping an object's internal state private and only exposing it through methods. This protects the integrity of the data.\n",

        "### **Inheritance:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A way to create a new class using an existing class. The new class (child) inherits the attributes and methods of the existing class (parent), but can also have additional features.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Polymorphism:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Allows objects of different types to be treated as if they are objects of a common parent class. Different classes can define the same method and behave differently when that method is called.\n",

        "Hides complex implementation details and shows only the necessary features of an object."
